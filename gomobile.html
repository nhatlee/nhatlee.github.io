            <h3>Experiences when use Gomobile to build framework.</h3>
            <p class="title">
            When you build a mobile native application for Android and iOS, you cannot avoid the duplicate code.<br />For example: the network module which use need to write in Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS.<br />However, you can use Gomobile to write this module and export to a framwork for those platform, when you need update somethings, you also just need to update once and export update framework for both Android and iOS.<br />
            Have many tutorials instruct you how to build it. So I don't want to do it again. I just want to shared some my experiences when working with GoMobile.
            
            <li>Slices array:</li>
            <p class="item">
            You cannot export functions with slice array into it to mobile framework. Let support I have a method <code>func getItemsFromKey(keys: []string) ([]string error)</code>. which passing a list of <code>keys</code> with type <code>string</code> and return list <code>values</code> with type <code>string</code>. But the problem is that: you cannot passing Array(Swift code) to this function like that.
