        <h3>Rough edges of Swift codable</h3>
        <p class="title">
          Swift codable help you to auto-generated Json to your object models
          more easily, faster.<br />
          Let's suppose we have a login api which will response the user info as
          the json:
          <pre>
          <code>
{ 
  "userid":1002, 
  "user_name":"nhatle", 
  "email":"lenhathk@gmail.com",
  "access_token":"akjfkadT10cm543sfdsf"
}
          </code>
          </pre>
          How to parse the json to your user model?. It's really easy, first of all you
          need define your user model like that:
        <pre>
          <code>
        struct UserModel: Codable {
            let id: Int
            let name: String
            let email: String
            let token: String
            enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
               case id = "userid"
              case name = "user_name"
               case email
               case token = "access_token"
              }
         }
          </code>
        </pre>
          As you see the field <code>email</code> in CodingKeys enum didn't have string to represent for it, just because the field name have same string with the
          key in json string. Now, you parse the json string to your model like that:<br/>
          <pre>
            <code>
             do {
              let jsonData = json.data(using: .utf8)!
              let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(UserModel.self, from: jsonData)
             }catch let error {
                 print(error.localizedDescription)
             }
            </code>
          </pre> 
          How about nested json? like that:
          <pre>
          <code>
            {
               "userid":1002,
               "user_name":"nhatle",
               "email":"lenhathk@gmail.com",
               "access_token":"akjfkadT10cm543sfdsf",
               "addresses":[
                 {
                   "street":"Linh Dong",
                    "city":"HO CHI MINH"
                },
                 {
                    "street":"Thanh Thai",
                    "city":"HO CHI MINH"
                 }
                ]
            }
          </code>
          </pre>
          Don't worry, you just need to change a little bit your user model and add <code>Address</code> model to make your code run properly:
          <pre>
            <code>
              struct UserModel: Codable {
                 let id: Int
                  let name: String
                 let email: String
                 let token: String
                 let addresses: [Address]
                 enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
                     case id = "userid"
                     case name = "user_name"
                    case email
                     case token = "access_token"
                     case addresses
                   }
                }

                struct Address: Codable {
                    let street: String
                   let city: String
                }
             </code>
          </pre>
          You done, with out need change any code in the place you parsed the json to your model as above.<br/>
          All things seem run smoothly until the day server team decided that into the response json of the login api <code>addresses</code>'s field is optional.
          It's mean some users will have addresses field and another will miss it. And the the code you did before not run for some users which don't have addresses.<br/>
          You can change the codable model to fixed it by adding <code>required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws</code> to your user model:
          <pre>
            <code>
              required init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
                let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
               self.name = try container.decodeIfPresent(String.self, forKey: .name) ?? "Your default value"
               ...
               self.addresses = try container.decodeIfPresent(Array&#60Address&#62.self, forKey: .addresses) ?? []
              }
              </code>
          </pre>
           Done! But it's still ridiculous that auto-generated methods cannot read the default values from optionals.<br/>
