When you build a mobile native application for Android and iOS, you cannot avoid the duplicate code.  
For example: the network module which use need to write in Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS.  
However, you can use Gomobile to write this module and export to a framwork for those platform, when you need update somethings, you also just need to update once and export update framework for both Android and iOS.  
Have many tutorials instruct you how to build it. So I don't want to do it again. I just want to shared some my experiences when working with GoMobile.

1. setup Gomobile

* Install Gomobile
